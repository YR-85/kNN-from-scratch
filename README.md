# kNN-from-scratch
ðŸ§  Implementing **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) from scratch** using only NumPy &amp; Pandas â€“ no ML libraries! A simple yet powerful approach to understanding one of the fundamental machine learning algorithms. 

Afterwards using the algorithm to classify Breast Cancer Types.

All the steps in the code are commented, so it should be easy to understand whats happening.

The [breast cancer databases](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic) was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg.
